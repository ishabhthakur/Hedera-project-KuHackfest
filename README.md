## Project Description
We Made a Transaction Web APP the Transaction and instantly provides you Transaction Confirmations Details.We Deploy Hedera Network Service( Smart Contracts) in our Project to build this application .

-We Deploy Hedera Network Service( Smart Contracts) in our Project to build this applications that provides us high throughput and low-latency consensus finality in seconds built on hedera .

We Made a Transaction web APP that will instantaneously execute the Transaction and instantly provides you Transaction Confirmations Details. We provide Speed of 10,000+ transactions/seconds. So that if user want to do Multiple Transaction it will be done in no time.
-This Services are working on the toP of hashgraph is a distributed consensus algorithm and data structure that is fast, fair, and secure.

-Suppose A person wants to send money to B person. Then his transfer is represented as a block . Then Block is broadcasted to everyone in the network . Approved as valid from everyone in the network. Now when the Block is added to the providing an indelible and transparent Record of Transaction. So Now with our Web app Using Hashgraph we Complete our transaction in no-time. i.e., 10x Faster than Block Chain Technology
